Q 1. What is the difference between getElementById, getElementsByClassName, and querySelector / querySelectorAll?

Ans : getElementById select by ID. it can select only one element.
getElementsByClassName select by class. it can select multiple with same class.
querySelector select by any valid selector (like: class, id, tagName). it selects only first one.
querySelectorAll selects by any valid selector. it selects multiple elements with same selector. (like: id, class, tag, etc..)
